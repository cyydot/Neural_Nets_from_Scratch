This contains my very first attempt at constructing neural network architecture from scratch.
Here's whats in this folder:

NN_1.py
  This Python script contains code for the network architecture. It is designed to compute 
  feed forward, fully connected neural networks. It's sections are as follows:

  1. This section contains the imports (numpy and random), code for the network layers, and
     code for cumputing the loss function. So far there are only three layer types: "linear",
     which performs matrix multiplcaton with no activation function, "relu", which performs a
     matrix multiplication followed by a ReLU activation, and "softmax", which has softmax as
     its activation function. Least Squares and Log-likelihood are used as 
  3.
